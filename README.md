                                        # Credit Risk Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, this project will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. This project uses imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, this project will oversample and undersample the data using algorithms. Then,  use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, it'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk. 

## Deliverables

This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

### Deliverable 1: Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
 Within this deleiverable the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification report will provide analysis of the high risk charateristics of borrowers.
 
 
### Deliverable 2: SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Within this deleiverable the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification report will provide analysis of the high risk charateristics of borrowers.

### Deliverable 3: Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
Within this deleiverable the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification reports for **Balanced Random Forest Classifer** and the **EasyEnsembleClassifier** will provide analysis of the high risk charateristics of borrowers.

### Deliverable 4: Summary on the Credit Risk Analysis 
In the first project deliverable (1 and 2) machine learning applications undersampled, oversampled and combination of both to determine which model provides the most reliabale data predicting which users might be high risk. The last deliverable presents two models resampling the data using ensemble classifiers to predict high or low risk. 

In Delvierables 1 and 2 the reported accuracy score was not as accurate as the ensemble classifiers. A useful model provides a balance of acurracy and precision lending to the recommendation to apply the ensemble classifiers if given the choice. The easy ensemble presents the most balance of the models.
