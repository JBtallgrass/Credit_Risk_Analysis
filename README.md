# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, this project will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. This project uses imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, this project will oversample and undersample the data using algorithms. Then,  use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, it'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

## Deliverables

This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk


### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

### Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
